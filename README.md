# AmraCord

__AmraCord__ is a very simple collection of classes for Discord Bot development
using [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA). A lot of trivial tasks have been simplified for faster and easier bot
development.

The documentation can be found [here](https://amraleth.xyz/amracord/overview).
